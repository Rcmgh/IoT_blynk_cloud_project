# IoT_blynk_cloud_project

The followins is a IoT cloud Project, where we can control a servo motor from the IoT cloud. Here we are using blynk cloud platform to do the same. Download the zip and run servo_control_blynk2.0 in the arduino ide. We also used an ESP32 wifi moule where the code was uploaded and connected to the cloud.
