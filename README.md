# IoT_blynk_cloud_project

The followins is a IoT cloud Project, where we can control a servo motor from the IoT cloud. Here we are using blynk cloud platform to do the same. Download the zip and run servo_control_blynk2.0 in the arduino ide. We also used an ESP32 wifi moule where the code was uploaded and connected to the cloud.

For uploading code in the wifi module, use the below packages:
